Recommended Engineering Manager Notes & Technical Constraints:

  Team & Resources:
  - Team: 2 senior mobile devs, 1 backend engineer, 1 DevOps engineer, 1 QA
  - Timeline: 4 months to MVP, 6 months to full launch
  - Budget: $250K for development + $50K for infrastructure first year

  Technology Stack:
  - Mobile: React Native (for iOS/Android code sharing)
  - Backend: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL database
  - Infrastructure: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3 for media storage)
  - Authentication: Auth0 or Firebase Auth
  - Analytics: Mixpanel for user analytics, Sentry for error tracking


Technical Requirements:
  - Performance: App launch <2s, API response <500ms for 95th percentile
  - Offline support: Core features (workout tracking) must work offline
  - Data sync: Background sync when connection restored
  - Battery optimization: <5% battery drain during 1-hour workout
  - Storage: <100MB app size, efficient local data caching

  Integration Requirements:
  - Apple HealthKit and Google Fit mandatory
  - Fitbit, Garmin, Whoop APIs for wearables
  - Stripe for payment processing
  - Push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging
  - Social sharing to Instagram/Facebook

  Security & Compliance:
  - HIPAA compliance for health data
  - GDPR compliance for EU users
  - End-to-end encryption for sensitive health data
  - SOC 2 Type II certification required by year 2
  - PCI DSS compliance for payment processing


Scalability Requirements:
  - Support 100K concurrent users by month 6
  - 1M users by end of year 1
  - Auto-scaling infrastructure
  - CDN for global content delivery
  - Database sharding strategy needed

  Development Constraints:
  - Must use existing company CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins)
  - Follow company mobile app architecture patterns
  - Integrate with existing user management system
  - Reuse company's design system components


- Weekly releases to TestFlight/Play Console beta

  Quality Requirements:
  - 99.9% uptime SLA
  - Crash-free rate >99.5%
  - Test coverage >80%
  - Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - Support iOS 14+ and Android 8+

  Dependencies:
  - Marketing team needs app 2 weeks before launch for campaigns
  - Legal review required for terms of service
  - App Store/Play Store review time (~1 week each)
  - Third-party API contracts need negotiation (2-3 weeks)


Why These Notes Work Well:

  1. Specific Technical Choices: Instead of "we need a database," specify
  "PostgreSQL"
  2. Quantifiable Metrics: "API response <500ms" instead of "fast performance"
  3. Team Context: The LLM knows exactly what expertise is available
  4. Constraints: Real-world limitations that affect architecture decisions
  5. Dependencies: External factors that impact technical design

  What the LLM Sees:

  Yes, when generating the specification, the LLM receives:
  1. The complete PRD (all sections you filled)
  2. Your engineering notes
  3. The specification template structure
  4. Previous conversation context (if any)

  This allows it to create a specification that:
  - Aligns with business goals from the PRD
  - Respects technical constraints from engineering notes
  - Follows the selected template format
  - Makes concrete technology recommendations

  The more specific your engineering notes, the more detailed and actionable the
  specification will be. The LLM will translate the business requirements from the
   PRD into technical implementation details based on your constraints.


Here are the additional details you requested:

  RISKS & ASSUMPTIONS:

 - Assume users will manually log data initially and pay $9.99/month premium
  - Risk: Device integration complexity may delay MVP 4-6 weeks
  - Risk: User acquisition costs may exceed $15/install
  - Mitigation: Build modular architecture, progressive feature rollout

  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
  - Workout logging must save/sync within 30 seconds
  - Barcode scanning must return results within 3 seconds
  - Device sync must complete within 60 seconds for 7 days data
  - App must work offline for core logging features

  UI/UX REQUIREMENTS:
  - Follow iOS/Material Design guidelines with dark mode support
  - Support accessibility (VoiceOver, high contrast, haptic feedback)
  - App launch under 3 seconds, screen transitions under 300ms
  - Progressive onboarding with smart defaults and minimal data entry

  Please generate the complete PRD now with all sections filled out.

  This should give the AI everything it needs to create a comprehensive, production-ready PRD
  document with all the missing sections properly detailed.
